			<h2>#9 - Max Verstappen</h2>
			
			<p>Throughout the past few years,the Dutch driver, Max Verstappen, has been dominating Formula one with his extraordinary pace. In 2022,</p>
			<p>Verstappen broke many records; with one of whichbeing the most amount of points by one driver in a season. Max smashed the</p>
			<p>previous record of 408 (previously set by lewis hamilton in 2018) and got an astounding 454 points.</p>
	<br />

			<p>As of now, Max is not anywhere near retiring from Formula 1,</p>
			<p>but with Verstappen's pace, now we wonder what other</p>
			<p>records he could end up breaking in the future.</p>

			<h2>#8 - Niki Lauda</h2>
		
			<p>The Austrian, Niki Lauda, won 3 Formula 1 world championships. Niki was an incredible driver, but especially in the '70s, and it was</p>
			<p>in 1976 when one of the most iconic crashes in F1 history happened. Lauda was way ahead in the championship; it was looking like</p>
			<p>Niki was going to take the world championship for the second time. But then Formula One travelled to one of the most dangerous tracks</p>
			<p>of all time. The Nürburgring. It had just rained, the track was wet, but also incredibly difficult to drive. And because of F1 safety</p>
			<p>back in the '70s, this race was just asking for one more fatality. After Niki's triumph to get the race cancelled, the race still went</p>
			<p>on. However, this is when disaster struck. Lauda was zooming round a turn, when he lost control of his car, and was slammed into the</p>
			<p>tracks barriers. His car burst into flames. Niki was stuck in the blaze for 55 seconds. Luckily, he managed to escape thanks to the</p>
			<p>help of fellow F1 driver Arturo Merzario. The crash nearly killind Niki after he inhaled hot toxic fumes and suffered severe burns.</p>
			<p>But instead of giving up, Niki was back racing just 40 days later. Niki carried on racing for 9 more years, when he retired in 1985.</p>

		<p>won his first world championship in 2008 when he was only at 23 years of age; after a very</p>
		<p>contreversal season with Felepe Massa. However, this would only the begining for Lewis. Afte</p>
		<p>rsix years with McLaren, Hamilton moved to Mercedes F1 team after some persuading from 3 time</p> 
		<p>world champion, Niki Lauda. This would end up being one of the best moves in history, because</p> 
		<p>Lewis would end up winning 6 world drivers championships in a row. A true, one of a kind,</p>

			<h2><b>#1 - Michael Schumacher</b></h2>
			
		<p>Michael Shcumacher. Born in Germany, Michael grew up with a natrual talent for racing. He</p>
		<p>started karting when he was just 4 years of age, and was fast; like, really fast. But it</p> 
		<p>was in 1991, when Michael would debut in the Belgain Grand Prix. That's when everyone saw</p>
		<p>Michael's natrual talent. He qualified 7th with his Jordan Ford, pretty good for his</p>
		<p>first ever qualifying. Undfortunately, about half way through the opening lap, Muchael's</p>
		<p>car had a clutch fail, so he had to retire. However, three years later, Schumacher would</p>
		<p>win his first drivers championship, in 1994, the same year Ayrton Senna sadly passed</p>
		<p>during the San Marino Grand Prix. Michael also won the championship in 1995, before</p>
		<p>moving to Ferrari in 1996. It took a bit for Ferrari to get into tip top shape, but in</p>
		<p>2000, everything came together. Michael Schumacher won his 3rd championship in 2000,</p>
		<p>before dominating the sport by winning 5 consecutive championships, in 2000, 2001, 2002,</p>
		<p>2003, and 2004. Michael is, and will always be an icon of Formula One.</p>
